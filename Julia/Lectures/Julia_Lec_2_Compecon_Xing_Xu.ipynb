    "* An infinitely lived representative household whose preferences are represented by a utility function $u(c) = \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\beta^t u(c_t)$, where $\\beta \\in (0, 1)$ is the discount factor. The household inelastically supplies 1 unit of labor each period.\n",

    "* The initial capital stock $k_0$ is given.\n",

    "Therefore, total feasibility constraint for the economy is thus $c_t + x_t \\leq F(k_t, l_t), \\forall t$, which is equivalent to $c_t + k_{t+1} \\leq F(k_t, l_t) + (1 - \\delta) k_t, \\forall t$. \n",

Also iteratively applying the consumption policy function, $c_0 = g_c(k_0)$, $c_1 = g_c(k_1)$, ....

For most dynamic programming problems with uncertainties (we will see in next couple lectures), vectorization is desirable and should be how the code will look like in the end. However in our simple example here, as you will see, without modifications, vectorization performs worse than loops, but it is a useful tool that one should keep in mind.\n",

    "##### 2.4.3 Why in this case vectorization is slightly slower?\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat GPT has a wonderful explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The vectorized version of the code is slower compared to the original loop version for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Memory usage: The vectorized version uses additional memory to store intermediate arrays, such as c and v_tmp, which can lead to increased memory usage and slower performance. This is especially true if the grid size N is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Array broadcasting: Broadcasting operations (.) in Julia can sometimes be less efficient compared to explicit loops, especially when dealing with large arrays. Broadcasting can result in unnecessary memory allocations and temporary arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cache efficiency: The vectorized version might not take advantage of CPU cache efficiency as effectively as the loop version. In the loop version, the calculations are done sequentially, which can utilize the CPU cache more efficiently. The vectorized version performs calculations across multiple elements simultaneously, which can lead to cache misses.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason unmentioned by GPT is that loops on Julia are very fast if written properly. If you are solving the same problem with loops on Python, you will find it to be much slower than what we managed to do. On the other side, there are a lot that can be done to speed up the vectorized version of the code above. With appropriate adjustments, the code can have similar, if not better performance than the loop version, which is something to keep in mind for an actual project. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, there's one trick we can apply on the last part. Note that we can pre-compute all consumption as for each k and k', consumption are fixed. This can also be done with the loop version but is much more convenient with vectorized VFI.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.4.4 Example for optimizing VFI with vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "This also works like magic. I just pulled a couple lines outside the loop but the efficiency rocketed."
